== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this theme support any plugins? =

Sans includes support for Jetpack's Infinite Scroll as well as other features.

= Should I change anything if I want to use this for my own site? =

Yep, you'll probably want to edit the `sans_footer_credits()` function in `inc/template-tags.php`. It has my name, copyright and some silly quotes. Remove or replace those with your own silly content. :)
